	<center><h1 style="border: inset; padding: 10px;">Summary Of &nbsp 'A Letter To God'</h1></center>
	<p id="A_Letter_To_God">Lencho was a dedicated farmer. He was expecting a decent harvest. However, to his grief, a hail storm came and destroyed his harvest completely. Lencho was very sad. However, he had a strong belief in God. He was certain that God would help him. Also, he was an extremely straightforward man. Although working for a long time on the farm, he knew writing. Thus, he composed a letter to God. In the letter, he asked God to send him one hundred pesos. At that point, he went to the post office and put his letter into the post box.<br><br>

	The postman removed the letter from the letter-box. He read the address on it and laughed very much. Also, he rushed to the postmaster and demonstrated to him that strange letter. Moreover, the postmaster also laughed in the same way when he saw the address of God. However, on reading the letter, he got very serious. He lauded this man who had unquestioned faith in God and decided to help him in terms of money. He asked the employees of the post office to give charity. Moreover, he gave a part of-of his salary too. However, they were able to collect only a little more than 50 pesos as requested for by Lencho. The postmaster put the money in an envelope. It was addressed to Lencho.<br><br>

	On Sunday, Lencho once again came to the post-office. He asked if there was a letter for him. The postmaster took out the letter and handed it to Lencho. Lencho was not surprised after seeing the money. But when he counted the money, he became angry on God. He was sure that God could not have made a mistake. He took paper and ink and wrote one more letter to God. Then he put it into the letter-box.<br><br>

	After Lencho had left the place, the postmaster and the employees read the letter. In it, Lencho had complained to God that he had received only seventy pesos. Also, he requested God to send him the rest of the money this time. However, he asked God not to send the money through the mail. He wrote that the post-office employees were a bunch of crooks and thus might have stolen the money.<br><br>

	We learnt that Faith has the power to give us what we want, to fulfil our needs However, one must realise that humanity still prevails.</p><br>


	<!-- summary of Nelson Mandela Long Walk To Freedom -->
	<center><h1 style="border: inset; padding: 10px;">Summary Of &nbsp 'Long Walk To Freedom'</h1></center>
	<p id="Long_Walk_To_Freedom">“A Long to Freedom”, by Nelson Mandela is all about the struggle of freedom of South-Africa. On May 10, 1994, Nelson Mandela has taken the vow as the first black president of South Africa. And therefore it was becoming a new-born democratic country. Nelson Mandela took the oath as the first black president.<br><br>

	Many dignitaries from different countries had come to be part of the most significant day. In his speech, Mandela thanked all those dignitaries. Mandela assured his countrymen that his country would never ever experience the same suppression of one by another. Democracy had been established in South Africa and as a result, a government of no discrimination was established.<br><br>

	The people of South Africa sang two National Anthems as a symbol of that day. Mandela recalled that the reason for this movement was that Black-skinned people were exploited by the White people. He said that this type of suppression of people of South Africa is the origin of many stars. People must learn to hate first, because if they hate then they can be taught to love, as love comes from the opposite circumstances. He also says that a brave man is not that who does not feel afraid but who conquers it.<br><br>

	In life, a man has two major obligations. First towards his family, to his parents, to his wife and to his children and second on the other hand obligation towards his country, people and the community. Everyone fulfils his duty as per his inclination and interest. But it was very tough to fulfil in a country like South Africa. When Mandela became an adult then he understood that his freedom was only an illusion. In fact, he was the slave of exploitation. He also understood that not only he was a slave but his other family members were also.<br><br>

	According to him, Freedom is also mandatory for them who were suppressing others in the past. They also have the right to have it because snatcher of other’s freedom is a prisoner of the same. Thus, the oppressor is as much a prisoner as the oppressed. The oppressor too is not free.<br><br>

	The brave man is not the one who does not feel afraid, but he is the one who conquers that fear. Mandela said that every man has his duties towards his country and community too</p>
